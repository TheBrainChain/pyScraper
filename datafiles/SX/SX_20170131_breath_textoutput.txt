64-bit Windows
InpOutx64 driver is open


PTB-INFO: This is Psychtoolbox-3 for Microsoft Windows, under Matlab 64-Bit (Version 3.0.11 - Build date: Dec 30 2013).
PTB-INFO: Type 'PsychtoolboxVersion' for more detailed version information.
PTB-INFO: Most parts of the Psychtoolbox distribution are licensed to you under terms of the MIT License, with
PTB-INFO: some restrictions. See file 'License.txt' in the Psychtoolbox root folder for the exact licensing conditions.

PTB-INFO: Will disable DWM because a regular fullscreen onscreen window is opened -> We want best timing and performance.
PTB-INFO: The detected endline of the vertical blank interval is equal or lower than the startline. This indicates
PTB-INFO: that i couldn't detect the duration of the vertical blank interval and won't be able to correct timestamps
PTB-INFO: for it. This will introduce a very small and constant offset (typically << 1 msec). Read 'help BeampositionQueries'
PTB-INFO: for how to correct this, should you really require that last few microseconds of precision.
PTB-INFO: Btw. this can also mean that your systems beamposition queries are slightly broken. It may help timing precision to
PTB-INFO: enable the beamposition workaround, as explained in 'help ConserveVRAM', section 'kPsychUseBeampositionQueryWorkaround'.


PTB-INFO: OpenGL-Renderer is NVIDIA Corporation :: GeForce GTX 660/PCIe/SSE2 :: 4.3.0
PTB-INFO: VBL startline = 1080 , VBL Endline = 1079
PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from beamposition = 6.944131 ms [144.006495 Hz].
PTB-INFO: Will use beamposition query for accurate Flip time stamping.
PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from VBLsync = 6.948815 ms [143.909427 Hz]. (50 valid samples taken, stddev=0.065395 ms.)
PTB-INFO: Reported monitor refresh interval from operating system = 6.944444 ms [144.000000 Hz].
PTB-INFO: Small deviations between reported values are normal and no reason to worry.
PTB-WARNING: ==============================================================================================================
PTB-WARNING: WINDOWS SYSTEM IS RUNNING IN MULTI-DISPLAY MODE! ALL FLIP STIMULUS ONSET TIMESTAMPS WILL BE LIKELY UNRELIABLE!
PTB-WARNING: STIMULUS ONSET TIMING WILL BE UNRELIABLE AS WELL, AND GRAPHICS PERFORMANCE MAY BE SEVERELY REDUCED!
PTB-WARNING: DO NOT USE MULTI-DISPLAY MODE FOR RUNNING REAL EXPERIMENT SESSIONS WITH ANY REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCURATE TIMING!
PTB-WARNING: ==============================================================================================================
PTB-INFO: Support for fast OffscreenWindows enabled.
